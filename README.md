# ffqc

(Work in progress!)

This is a mock version of FastQC called ffqc. It currently just makes the main graph after handling input.

# Install instructions

Installation requires the `Biopython`, `numpy`, `pandas`,  and `seaborn` libraries to be installed. You can install these with `pip`:

```
pip install Bio numpy pandas seaborn
```

Once required libraries are installed, you can install `ffqc` with the following command:

```
python setup.py install
```

Note: if you do not have root access, you can run the commands above with additional options to install locally:
```
pip install --user Bio numpy pandas seaborn
python setup.py install --user
```

If the install was successful, typing `ffqc --help` should show a useful message.

# Basic usage

The basic usage of `ffqc` is:

```
ffqc [-d output directory] [other options] in.fq
```

To run `ffqc` on a test example (using files in this repo):
```
ffqc -d output files/NA12878_child_1.fq
```

This should produce a png file named outputmainfig.png in the output directory plotting quality per position.

To compare to output of `fastqc`, run:
```
fastqc files/NA12878_child_1.fq
```

then it should generate an html file. You can open this file in a browser, and our figure should be similar to the top figure of fastqc's output.

# ffqc options

The only required input to `ffqc` is a fastqc file. However, the -d directory is recommended unless you want everything dumped to your current working directory. 

* `-d DIRECTORY`, `--directory DIRECTORY`: directory all images will output to.



# File format

The current output file format is a png of a graph. In the future there should be more than 1.

# Testing

run this command to unit test. NOTE: If you delete/rename files in the test_files folder this may not work
```
 python ffqc/tests.py
```
